# FluScan

FluScan is an IPv4 Scanner for Internet designed by Flu Project Team (http://www.flu-project.com). 

FluScan has been developed in Python. 

To launch FluScan, you need to specify both first and last IP addresses in the last lines of main code:

ip1 = 'A.B.C.D'

ip2 = 'V.X.Y.Z'

Also, you need to modify the connection data of the MongoDB database.

Next, you have to execute the tool using this command:

> python FluScan.py
